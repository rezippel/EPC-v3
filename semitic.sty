% This is a very simple LaTeX substyle to set Semitic. It is a very much a
% hacked HEBREW.TeX distributed with the HEBREW fonts.

% Note: I replaced Hebrew by Semitic everywhere in this file.J.Goldberg.
% WHAT IT DOES:
%   * Reverses order of letters in words.
%   * Reverses order of words on a line (sets right-to-left).
%
% Use it as follows:
% \documentstyle[semitic,...]{...}
%           .
%           .
%           .
% Normal text here
% \begin{semitic}
% Semitic text in `natural direction'.  Type Semitic paragraph as
% you would any `normal' paragraph in a LaTeX document.
% \end{semitic}
% More text ...
%           .
%           .
%           .
%
% NOTES:
%   * There is now no need to put only 1 semitic word on a line. Treat the
%     Semitic text as `normal' text.
%   * There can be no space between `\end' and `{semitic}' in
%     `\end{semitic}' (similar to the verbatim environment).
%   * To keep something together enclose it in braces, e.g., {text together}
%     This will stop it being broken over a line but it will the contents
%     will still be reversed.
%   * To keep something together and to STOP IT BEING REVERSED enclose it
%     in 2 sets of braces, e.g.,
%        {{$\sin(\theta + \frac{\pi}{2}) = \cos \theta$}}
%   * The text is processed in LR mode and then formed into lines. Anything
%     that starts a new paragraph, e.g., displayed maths, will cause problems.
%     This also mean that no blank lines can appear in the environment.
%   * A new paragraph is started before and after the semitic environment.
