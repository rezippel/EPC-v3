	Abstract = {Conservative garbage collectors are commonly used in
                  combination with conventional C programs.
                  Empirically, this usually works well.  However,
                  there are no guarantees that this is safe in the
                  presence of ``improved'' compiler optimization.  We
                  propose that C compilers provide a facility to
                  suppress optimizations that are unsafe in the
                  presence of concervative garbage collection.  Such a
                  facility can be added to an exisitng compiler at
                  very minimal cost, provided the additional analysis
                  is done in a machine-independent source-to-source
                  prepass.  Such a prepass may also check the source
                  code for garbage-collector-safety.},

             speed compressible flow involve marching in a ``time like''
             spatial coordinate but have been observed in practice to be
             sensitive to flow conditions and require stabilization by
             numerical dissipation techniques. In this study we develop an
             eigenvalue analysis for shock stability. Using the algebraic
             symbolc manipulator MACSYMA, an explicit closed form solution fo
             the shock system eigen values is developed. This is then applied
             on the evolving shock contour to determine the stability limit on
             the PNS stepsize. Numeical experiments confirm the validity of
             the approach and demonstrsate that the approach can be
             implemented explicitly to yield an adaptive stepsize algorithm
             and thereby a more robust PNS scheme.},

	Abstract = {Wavelets are new families of basis functions that yield the
             representations $f(x)=\sum b_{jk}W(2^j x-k)$. Their construction
             begins with the solution $\phi(x)$ to a dilation equation with
             coefficients $c_k$. Then $W$ comes from $\phi$, and the basis
             comes by translation and dilation of $W$. It is shown in Part 1
             how conditions on the $c_k$ lead to approximation properties and
             orthogonality properties of the wavelets. Part 2 describes the
             recursive algorithms (also based on the $c_k$) that decompose and
             reconstract $f$. The object of wavelets is to localize as far as
             possible in both time and frequency, with efficient algorithms.},

We show that the number of $k$-operations is polynomially bounded by the complexity of the singularity, as measured for example by the index of its conductor ideal. Our algorithm involves calculations over reduced rings with zero divisors, and emplys methods of deformation theory to reduce the consideration of power series to consideration of polynomials.},
