                  Empirically, this usually works well.  However,
                  there are no guarantees that this is safe in the
                  presence of ``improved'' compiler optimization.  We
                  propose that C compilers provide a facility to
                  suppress optimizations that are unsafe in the
                  presence of concervative garbage collection.  Such a
                  facility can be added to an exisitng compiler at
                  very minimal cost, provided the additional analysis
                  is done in a machine-independent source-to-source
                  prepass.  Such a prepass may also check the source

                  for high speed compressible flow involve marching in
                  a ``time like'' spatial coordinate but have been
                  observed in practice to be sensitive to flow
                  conditions and require stabilization by numerical
                  dissipation techniques. In this study we develop an
                  eigenvalue analysis for shock stability. Using the
                  algebraic symbolc manipulator MACSYMA, an explicit
                  closed form solution fo the shock system eigen
                  values is developed. This is then applied on the
                  evolving shock contour to determine the stability
                  limit on the PNS stepsize. Numeical experiments
                  confirm the validity of the approach and
                  demonstrsate that the approach can be implemented
                  explicitly to yield an adaptive stepsize algorithm
                  and thereby a more robust PNS scheme.}

                  illustrated by simple but by no means trivial
                  programming examples.  The description of compiler
                  and full function reference are included.  The book

                  yield the representations $f(x)=\sum b_{jk}W(2^j
                  x-k)$. Their construction begins with the solution
                  $\phi(x)$ to a dilation equation with coefficients
                  $c_k$. Then $W$ comes from $\phi$, and the basis
                  comes by translation and dilation of $W$. It is
                  shown in Part 1 how conditions on the $c_k$ lead to
                  approximation properties and orthogonality
                  properties of the wavelets. Part 2 describes the
                  recursive algorithms (also based on the $c_k$) that
                  decompose and reconstract $f$. The object of
                  wavelets is to localize as far as possible in both
                  time and frequency, with efficent algorithms.}

                  in a (not necessarily algebraically closed) field
