                     transformation algorithm is based on two concepts: a
                     mathematical formulation of reuse and locality, and a loop
                     transformation theory that unifies the various transforms
                     as unimodular matrix transformations.The algorithm has
                     been implemented in the SUIF (Stanford University
                     Intermediate Format) compiler, and is successful in
                     optimizing codes such as matrix multiplication, successive
                     over-relaxation (SOR), LU decomposition without pivoting,
                     and Givens QR factorization. Performance evaluation

              unsafe in the presence of concervative garbage collection. Such a
              facility can be added to an exisitng compiler at very minimal
              cost, provided the additional analysis is done in a
              machine-independent source-to-source prepass. Such a prepass may

  abstract  = "Diophantine equations over number fields have formed one of the
               most important and fruitful areas of mathematics throughout
               civilisation. In recent years increasing interest has been
               aroused in the analogous area of equations over function fields.
               However, although considerable progress has been made by
               previous authors, none has attempted the central problem of
               providing methods for the actual solution of such equations. The
               latter is the purpose and achievement of this volume: algorithms
               are provided for the complete resolution of various families of
               equations, such as those of Thue, hyperelliptic and genus one
               type. The results are achieved by means of an original
               fundamental inequality, first announced by the author in 1982.
               Several specific examples are included as illustrations of the
               general method and as a testimony to its efficiency.
               Furthermore, bounds are obtained on the solutions which improve
               on those obtained previously by other means. Extending the
               equality to a different setting, namely that of positive
               characteristic, enables the various families of equations to be
               resolved in that circumstance. Finally, by applying the
               inequality in a different manner, simple bounds are determined
               on their solutions in rational functions of the general
               superelliptic equation. This book represents a self-contained
               account of a new approach to the subject, and one which plainly
               has not reached the full extent of its application. It also
               provides a more direct on the problems than any previous book.
               Little expert knowledge is required to follow the theory
               presented, and it will appeal to professional mathematicians,
               research students and the enthusiastic undergraduate.",

               many of today's software developers most of what they know about
               computer programming. -Byte, September 1995 I can't begin to
               tell you how many pleasurable hours of study and recreation they
               have afforded me! I have pored over them in cars, restaurants,
               at work, at home... and even at a Little League game when my son
               wasn't in the line-up. -Charles Long If you think you're a
               really good programmer... read [Knuth's] Art of Computer
               Programming... You should definitely send me a resume if you can
               read the whole thing. -Bill Gates It's always a pleasure when a
               problem is hard enough that you have to get the Knuths off the
               shelf. I find that merely opening one has a very useful
               terrorizing effect on computers. -Jonathan Laventhol The first
               revision of this third volume is the most comprehensive survey
               of classical computer techniques for sorting and searching. It
               extends the treatment of data structures in Volume 1 to consider
               both large and small databases and internal and external
               memories. The book contains a selection of carefully checked
               computer methods, with a quantitative analysis of their
               efficiency. Outstanding features of the second edition include a
               revised section on optimum sorting and new discussions of the
               theory of permutations and of universal hashing. Ebook (PDF

  abstract = "Wavelets are new families of basis functions that yield the
              representations $f(x)=\sum b_jkW(2^j x-k)$. Their construction
              begins with the solution $\phi(x)$ to a dilation equation with
              coefficients $c_k$. Then $W$ comes from $\phi$, and the basis
              comes by translation and dilation of $W$. It is shown in Part 1
              how conditions on the $c_k$ lead to approximation properties and
              orthogonality properties of the wavelets. Part 2 describes the
              recursive algorithms (also based on the $c_k$) that decompose and
              reconstract $f$. The object of wavelets is to localize as far as
              possible in both time and frequency, with efficent algorithms.",

               project of the Symbolic Com putation Group at the University of
               Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. This manual corresponds with
               version V (roman numeral five) of the Maple system. The on-line
               help subsystem can be invoked from within a Maple session to
               view documentation on specific topics. In particular, the
               command ?updates points the user to documentation updates for
               each new version of Maple. The Maple project was first conceived
               in the autumn of 1980, growing out of discussions on the state
               of symbolic computation at the University of Waterloo. The
               authors wish to acknowledge many fruitful discussions with
               colleagues at the University of Waterloo, particularly Morven
               Gen tleman, Michael Malcolm, and Frank Tompa. It was recognized
               in these discussions that none ofthe locaIly-available systems
               for symbolic computation provided the facilities that should be
               expected for symbolic computation in modern computing
               environments. We concluded that since the basic design decisions
               for the then-current symbolic systems such as ALTRAN, CAMAL,
               REDUCE, and MACSYMA were based on 1960's computing technology,
               it would be wise to design a new system ``from scratch''. Thus
               we could take advantage of the software engineering technology
               which had become available in recent years, as well as drawing
               from the lessons of experience. Maple's basic features
               (elementary data structures, Input/output, arithmetic with
               numbers, and elementary simplification) are coded in a systems
               programming language for efficiency.",

               interest. All the built-in mathematical, graphic, and system
               based commands available in Maple V Release 4 are detailed
               herein. Please note that The Maple Handbook does not teach the
               mathematics behind Maple commands. If you do not know the
               meaning of such concepts as definite integral, identity matrix,
               or prime integer, do not expect to learn them here. As well,
               while the introductory sections to each chapter taken together
               provide a basic overview of the capabil ities of Maple, it is
               highly recommended that you also read a more thorough tutorial
               such as Introduction to Maple by Andre Heck, or one of standard
               manuals shipped with Maple V Release 4. Overall Organization One
               of the main premises of The Maple Handbook is that most Maple
               users approach the system to solve a particular problem (or set
               of prob lems) in a specific subject area. Therefore, all
               commands are organized in logical subsets that reflect these
               different categories, e.g., calculus, algebra, data
               manipulation, etc.; the commands within a subset are ex plained
               in a similar language, creating a tool that allows you quick and
               confident access to the information necessary to complete the
               problem you have brought to the system.",

  abstract  = "This textbook covers the basic properties of elliptic curves and
               modular forms, with emphasis on certain connections with number
               theory. The ancient ``congruent number problem'' is the central
               motivating example for most of the book. My purpose is to make
               the subject accessible to those who find it hard to read more
               advanced or more algebraically oriented treatments. At the same
               time I want to introduce topics which are at the forefront of
               current research. Down-to-earth examples are given in the text
               and exercises, with the aim of making the material readable and
               interesting to mathematicians in fields far removed from the
               subject of the book. With numerous exercises (and answers)
               included, the textbook is also intended for graduate students
               who have completed the standard first-year courses in real and
               complex analysis and algebra. Such students would learn
               applications of techniques from those courses, thereby
               solidifying their under standing of some basic tools used
               throughout mathematics. Graduate stu dents wanting to work in
               number theory or algebraic geometry would get a motivational,
               example-oriented introduction. In addition, advanced under
               graduates could use the book for independent study projects,
               senior theses, and seminar work.",

               about expressions involving radicals. Symbolic computations with
               simple, non-nested, radicals is relatively straightforward;
               however, when the radicals are nested the problem becomes more
               difficult, This paper presents an algorithm for determining a
               linearly independent basis for a set of radicals (nested or
               not). This allows elementary techniques to be used for
               arithmetic operations on expressions involving elements of this
               set. In addition we provide a structure theorem that provides a
               sufficient condition for a nested radical to be expressed in
               terms of radicals of lower nesting level. These two techniques

                     solve. These demand both rapid execution times and
                     efficient storage management. We achieve rapid execution
                     by not investing symbols with their full algebraic
                     significance. For example, this eliminates the need for
                     built-in rational function capabilities or for a very
                     general integration routine, but does require more user

                     internal data structures and a processing scheme which
                     allow intermediate expressions to be virtual and which
